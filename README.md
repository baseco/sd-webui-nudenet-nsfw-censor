# Stable Diffusion Web UI - NudeNet NSFW Censor

This is a fork of a [Stable Diffusion web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) extension that uses [NudeNet](https://github.com/notAI-tech/NudeNet) to detect NSFW regions in an image, allowing for partial censoring of the image, useful when sharing images NSFW images on social media.

### Features
- `Image generation` and `Live preview`
- Auto and manual censor `Extras tab` tab
- Post-processing via `Extras tab` 
- Partial censoring of the image
- Customizable censoring categories
- Multiple censoring methods
- API

---

### Filter types
- `Gaussian Blur`: Blur the image control with `Blur strength`
- `Variable blur`: Applies varying strength blur strength based of the grayscale value of the mask, making the censor border less eye jarring. **Warning CPU intensive**.
- `Pixelate`: Pixelated Mosaic effect.
- `Fill color`: Fill a specified color
- `No censor`: No filter is applied, but the NudeNet detection mask is still generated, use when you only want the mask but donâ€™t want to censor the image.
- `Disable`: Disable this extension for this workflow

---

## Settings
Settings can be found under `Settings` > `NudeNet NSFW Censor`

- `Enable Region censor for image generation`: enables/disables NudeNet censor for image generation
- `Save a copy of the image before applying censor`: Save a copy of the image before applying censor 
- `Save censor mask`: Save the mask generated by NudeNet 
- `Generation censor filter`: censor filter used for the final generated image
- `Live preview censor filter`: censor filter used during `Live preview`
- `Extras censor filter`: the default censor filter used for `Extras tab`
- `Mask shape`: the mask shape applied on the detected regions
- `Rectangle round radius`: controls the corner rounding radius when `Mask shape` is `Rounded rectangle`
- - different ranges of value have different meaning
- - [0, 1]: round ratio, 0.5 will round 50%, round radius will scale with the mask size
- - (0, inf): round unit, round radius will scale with the image size
- - (-inf, 0): absolute pixel, round radius will absolute value in pixels
- - note: due to a bug with Pillow 9.5.0 `Rounded rectangle` can fail to draw the mask

### Filter parameters
- `Blur strength`: Controls the blur strength for `Gaussian Blur` and `Variable blur`.

- `Mask blend strength`: applies to `Gaussian Blur`, `Pixelate`, `Fill color`<br>
apply blur to the detected mask, softening the censor border, if the value is too high the censor area might be transparent.
- `Mask blend strength - Variable blur`: controls the size of the censor transition border Apply blur to the detected mask, grayscale value is used to control the strength blur.
- `Blur strength curve - Variable blur`: Controls the blur strength gradient.
- - Value range [0, 6]
- - 0: No blur
- - 3: linear strength
- - 4: linear with mask grayscale value
- - 6: Entire image Max blur

- `Pixelation factor`: Controls pixelation strength

- `Fill color`: Fill the detected region with this color


### Detection configuration
- `Categories to be censored`: NudeNet has 18 categories of body parts<br>
Select which you wish to censor, each type has three values that you can adjust `threshold` `horizontal multiplier` and `vertical multiplier`

- `threshold`: confidence threshold of when the detected region is used<br>
typically a threshold of 0.25~0.5 should be a good range to reliably detect a category,<br>
setting this to a high value means that it will only trigger censoring when it's more confident, setting it to `1` is the same as disabling a category, on the other hand setting a low value would make censoring easier to trigger but also more chance of erroneously detecting regions
- `horizontal multiplier` and `vertical multiplier`:
to compensate NudeNet's detection often is off-centered or does not cover the entire body part, the origin NudeNet detected region can be enlarged by `horizontal multiplier` and `vertical multiplier` expanding the masked area covering a larger region.

<details><summary>List of NudeNet categories</summary>

- `Anus covered`
- `Anus exposed`
- `Armpits covered`
- `Armpits exposed`
- `Belly covered`
- `Belly exposed`
- `Buttocks covered`
- `Buttocks exposed`
- `Face female`
- `Face male`
- `Feet covered`
- `Feet exposed`
- `Female breast covered`
- `Female breast exposed`
- `Female genitalia covered`
- `Female genitalia exposed`
- `Male breast exposed`
- `Male genitalia exposed`

</details> 


- `Non-Maximum Suppression threshold`: Discard overlapping detected regions,
- - set to 1 disables NMS
note that NMS is performed prior to the adjustment of the detected regions

- `Print detection info in terminal`: Print info about detected mask regions, used for tweaking values, does not work when mask shape is set to `Entire image`

## API example
`/nudenet/censor`

- all parameters are optional, if not specified it will use the parameter configured in the settings, if they configuration already configured in the settings then the payload can be just the `input_image` alone
- `enable_nudenet` is enabled by default
- if no censoring is apply to the image then image will return `None`
